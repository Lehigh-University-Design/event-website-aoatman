					<p><u>Camp Again has a detailed <a href="packinglist.html" target="_self">packing list</a> on our website</u>.
					<br>
					- The attire needed for camp is casual, athletic, and comfortable. Most people bring some kind of sneaker and casual shoe (croc, flip-flop, teva, chacos, etc.) to wear throughout the weekend. 
					<br>
					- Nicer more dressy clothes are only needed for our closing award ceremony, so just one of those outfits is good to pack.
					<br>
					- Keep in mind that while the event is held on Labor Day Weekend when it typically is quite warm during the day, at night in Vermont it can get quite chilly, so it's a  good idea to bring long pants, a light jacket, or sweats.

	<!--FAQ Questions: 1) How do I get the spacing between the question in orange and the text to be smaller? 2) How to I in this format make sure that there is no text showing when I havent clicked on a box? 3) Can I have the open close feature with an arrow or something instead of a plus or minus so it takes up the same amount of space? 4)how do I make another list inside a list (without having the list element follow the same style as i set in the accordion)? Media Queries?-->
