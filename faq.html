				<label for="seventh"><h4>What Should I Pack for Camp?</h4></label>
				<div class="content">
					<p class="answer"><u>Camp Again has a detailed <a href="packinglist.html" target="_self">packing list</a> on our website</u>.
					- The attire needed for camp is casual, athletic, and comfortable. Most people bring some kind of sneaker and casual shoe (croc, flip-flop, teva, chacos, etc.) to wear throughout the weekend. 
					- Nicer more dressy clothes are only needed for our closing award ceremony, so just one of those outfits is good to pack.
					- Keep in mind that while the event is held on Labor Day Weekend when it typically is quite warm during the day, at night in Vermont it can get quite chilly, so it's a  good idea to bring long pants, a light jacket, or sweats.
